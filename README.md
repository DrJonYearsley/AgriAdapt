# AgriAdapt

Aphids are ubiquitous crop pests that can cause significant yield losses in economically important cereals. The grain aphid (*Sitobion avenae*) is one of the most economically important pests of cereal crops internationally, and is the major vector of Barley/Cereal yellow dwarf virus (B/CYDV) in Ireland, with yield losses ranging from 5% to 80%.

This project is part of the DAFM funded AgriAdapt project; a collaboration between Teagasc, UCD and Dundalk Institute of Technology. AgriAdapt is focussed on developing strategies for Irish agriculture to adapt to the challenges posed by climate change.

This modelling project has three specific tasks:

   + To predict the optimal timing of insecticide spraying in current climate
   + To predict aphid and virus pressure in changing climate
   + To link aphid and viral loads with landscape features
